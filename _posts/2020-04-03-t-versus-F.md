Hypothesis Testing under Normality: t vs. F
================
Vinicius Lima

A common question among students facing the problem of testing hypothesis in a multiple regression framework: What is the problem in making individual tests if I am interested in a joint hypothesis?

Well, things become clear with some data and and even better with nice graphs.

Including Code
--------------

You can include R code in the document as follows:

``` r
summary(cars)
```

    ##      speed           dist       
    ##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
    ##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
    ##  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
    ##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
    ##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
    ##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00

Including Plots
---------------

You can also embed plots, for example:

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
