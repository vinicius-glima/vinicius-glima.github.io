###### I have always developed some programs to understand and explain concepts in Probability, Statistics and Econometrics. Also, I have spent hours in building graphs or in data wrangling. This blog is the way I found to organize most of this work forming a kind of personal libray that I share with people who may find it useful. 

###### Enjoy ;)
