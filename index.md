I have always developed some programs to understand and explain concepts in Probability, Statistics and Econometrics. Also, I have spent hours in building graphs or in data wrangling. This blog is the way I found to organize most of this work, forming a kind of personal library. I hope you end up finding some useful stuff over here. 

Enjoy ;)
